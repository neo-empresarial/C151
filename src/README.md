# Source Code Directory (`src/`)

## Overview
This directory contains the source code for the application, split into logical modules.

## Structure
-   **`core/`**: Contains the backend logic for face recognition and database management.
-   **`gui/`**: Contains the user interface code built with PySide6.

## Usage
The `main.py` entry point (in the parent directory) imports modules from here to launch the application.
